This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Inspiration
The outbreak of COVID-19 has proven to be a stressful and anxiety-provoking time for many people. Seeing as the entire world is currently undergoing quarantine conditions, we were inspired to create a tool that would help the community adapt to these social changes by creating a routine. We envisioned a platform that would encourage everyone to 1) help themselves through developing healthy & enjoyable habits 2) help others by contributing to those businesses/hospitals/vulnerable populations in need.

## What it does
The landing page is a split screen where users could pick either 'Help Yourself' or 'Help Others' (this also serves as a reminder that in these times of uncertainty, helping yourself and taking care of yourself will put you in a better position to care for others).

Users can drag "blocks" of things to do to a daily schedule, and set their routine for the day.

Users are able to submit new "blocks" and ideas. For example, since things that we can do to help the community changes everyday, it is a useful platform to consolidate all the ways to help others, and a fun platform for people to share their #quaroutines.






### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

##### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

##### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

##### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

##### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
